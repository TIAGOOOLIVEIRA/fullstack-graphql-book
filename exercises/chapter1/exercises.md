# Chapter One Exercises

1. To familiarize yourself with GraphQL and writing GraphQL queries, explore the public movies GraphQL API at `https://movies.grandstack.io`. Open the URL in a web browser to access GraphQL Playground and explore the `DOCS` and `SCHEMA` tab to see the type definitions. 

Try writing queries to answer the following questions:

  * Find the titles of the first 10 movies, ordered by title.
  * Who acted in the movie "Jurassic Park"?
  * What are the genres of "Jurassic Park"? What other movies are in those genres?
  * What movie has the highest `imdbRating`?

2. Consider the business reviews application we described earlier in the chapter. See if you can create the GraphQL type definitions necessary for this application.

3. Download Neo4j and familiarize yourself with Neo4j Desktop and Neo4j Browser. Work through a neo4jsandbox.com example dataset guide.
